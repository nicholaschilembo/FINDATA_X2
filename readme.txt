# FINDataX: Decentralized Financial Data Management
FINDataX is a decentralized platform that aims to revolutionize financial data management by leveraging the power of blockchain technology. Built on the principles of transparency, security, and data sovereignty, FINDataX empowers stakeholders to maintain control over their sensitive financial data while enabling secure and auditable data sharing within the financial ecosystem.

## Features

- **Decentralized Data Storage**: Financial data is securely stored and distributed across a decentralized network, eliminating single points of failure and reducing the risk of data breaches.
- **Permissioned Blockchain Network**: FINDataX operates on a permissioned blockchain network, ensuring that only authorized participants can access and interact with the platform.
- **Granular Access Control**: Stakeholders have complete control over their data and can grant or revoke access permissions to specific data sets or documents.
- **Audit Trail and Compliance**: All data transactions and access events are recorded on the immutable blockchain, enabling regulatory compliance and auditing.
- **Secure Data Sharing**: The platform facilitates secure and encrypted data sharing between authorized stakeholders, promoting collaboration and data exchange within the financial industry.
